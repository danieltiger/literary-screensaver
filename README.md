# Literary Screensaver

A macOS screensaver that displays the time in the form of literary quotes. Inspired by the [Literary Clock Made from E-Reader](https://www.instructables.com/id/Literary-Clock-Made-From-E-reader/) project. Quote-to-time mapping data are sourced from this project.

This project was forked from the one made by [James Liu](https://github.com/disposedtrolley/literary-screensaver) and then extended.
